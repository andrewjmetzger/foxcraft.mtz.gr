## Introduction

Foxcraft is a custom Forge-based modpack for Minecraft that features an exciting combination of mods from all corners of Minecraftia.

## Included mods

Foxcraft uses mods to enhance gameplay and provide an immersive experience. Here are just a few of the mods installed:

* Ars Magica 2
* Galacticraft
* OreSpawn
* Tinker's Construct
* ... and [dozens of other mods](/about/mod-list) to explore ...

## Foxcraft's Custom Resource Pack

To ensure the most immersive experience, Foxcraft bundles custom textures for many of the blocks in the game. For players with Server Resource Packs enabled, the custom look should be used automatically. Players with Server Resource Packs disabled should [download the resource pack manually](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewjmetzger/foxcraft.mtz.gr/{{ site.modpackVersion }}/static/resourcepacks/FoxcraftCustom/FoxcraftCustom.zip), and apply it before playing.

### Legalese

Mods included with love and permission where available, or hugs of forgiveness in all other territories.

Foxcraft's vanilla block textures are lovingly borrowed from [Werian by Filmjolk](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/resource-packs/wip-resource-pack/1259157-32x-1-7-2-1-6-4-filmjolks-medieval-werian-v-0-6-2) (&copy; Filmjolk, All Rights Reserved).
