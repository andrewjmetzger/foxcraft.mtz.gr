## Introduction

Foxcraft is a custom Forge-based modpack for Minecraft that features an exciting combination of mods from all corners of Minecraftia. All mods included with love and permission where available, or hugs of forgiveness in all other territories.

## Included mods

Foxcraft uses mods to enhance gameplay and provide an immersive experience. Here are just a few of the mods installed:

* Ars Magica 2
* Galacticraft
* OreSpawn
* Tinker's Construct
* ... and [dozens of other mods](/about/mod-list) to explore ...

## Custom Resource Pack

To ensure the most immersive experience, Foxcraft bundles textures for many of the blocks added to the game. Although installing the custom resource pack is not required to play Foxcraft, doing so is highly recommended.

### Legalese

Some vanilla block textures lovingly borrowed from [Werian by Filmjolk](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/resource-packs/wip-resource-pack/1259157-32x-1-7-2-1-6-4-filmjolks-medieval-werian-v-0-6-2) (&copy; Filmjolk, All Rights Reserved).
