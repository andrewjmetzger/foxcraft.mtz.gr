These templates are created by Jordan Peacock (AKA Jordan_Greywolf)
and Wendy Peacock (AKA Kujaku10) via AtomicStryker's ruins mod.

Updated: 8 May 2018

To use, you will need Minecraft (version 1.7.10), plus 
AtomicStryker's Ruins mod.

For AtomicStryker's Ruins mod:
https://mods.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/227873-ruins-structure-spawning-system

To use these templates, put the folders in the following Minecraft 
installation folder (exact path may vary depending upon your installation):

*\.minecraft\mods\resources\ruins\
(NOTE: Ruins for certain later versions of Minecraft will install in a different folder.  These instructions are specific to THIS version.)

If you're asked to merge folders, go ahead.  This will just add 
the templates to those currently in the affected biomes folders 
(possibly overwriting older versions of the same templates).

ADVENTURE - COMMAND BLOCKS:
This is basically the "master bundle" of all my "Vanilla Minecraft"
Ruins structures for MC 1.7.10, including several with traps,
monsters, and custom Command Block features.

In the file name, the "CB" refers to Command Blocks.  The "no CB"
version has any template that uses Command Blocks either stripped
out, or else is modified to avoid Command Blocks (for instance,
using "Vanilla" mob spawners, or using TNT for traps instead of
the /effect command).  The "Peaceful" versions (as opposed to
"Adventure") strip out any templates that introduce monsters and
traps, for those who just want some interesting scenery without
introducing new levels of danger.

This ZIP folder is the most inclusive version.  If you're fine with
traps and monsters and if you've enabled Command Blocks in your
game (only really an issue for multiplayer servers), this is the 
ZIP folder for you.  The other ZIP folders would just be
redundant.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

OPTIONAL - NATURA:
Templates in the "optional - natura" folder should only be used if you have the Natura mod installed for MC 1.7.10.
If you wish to use these, move all the templates in this folder to your "sky" biome folder.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

File naming conventions:

JordanGreywolf's templates are prefaced by "JG_"; Kujaku10's
templates are prefaced by "K10_".

File names with "CB" in them include Command Blocks.  If "NOCB"
is in the file name, this template was originally created with
Command Blocks, but this is an alternative version that removes
them.  

Any marked as "peaceful" are alternative versions that
take out any deliberate traps and mob spawners (though monsters
may still spawn normally in the darkness).

"1v7v10" means that the template was created or modified for
Minecraft version 1.7.10 (and for the version of Ruins that corresponds to it).

Special Thanks to:

* Gillymoth for help learning the ropes.

* Syndaryl and MentalMouse42 for help with bug fixes.

* Kujaku10 for additional templates!

* A1c3e5 for explaining the "/setblock ~ ~ ~ {}" trick for getting 
data for teBlock rules (such as flower pots).

* ... and especially to AtomicStryker for maintaining and improving 
my favorite Minecraft mod!  :)

Usage notes for Kujaku10's and JordanGreywolf's templates:

If you have a Minecraft modpack including AtomicStryker's Ruins, you 
are WELCOME to use any or all of our (Kujaku10's and JordanGreywolf's) 
templates, and to modify them to best fit your setup.  Please feel 
free to copy parts of these structures, to borrow ideas for custom 
mobs, traps, and so forth.  Some of these templates are specifically 
intended as "proof-of-concept" to share ideas with other Ruins builders.

If you do include these in a modpack, I'd love to hear about it on the 
Ruins forum thread or via PM.  :)
