## Custom Resource Pack

To ensure the most immersive experience, Foxcraft bundles textures for many of the blocks added to the game. Although installing the custom resource pack is not required to play Foxcraft, doing so is highly recommended.

### Legalese

Some vanilla block textures lovingly borrowed from [Werian by Filmjolk](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/resource-packs/wip-resource-pack/1259157-32x-1-7-2-1-6-4-filmjolks-medieval-werian-v-0-6-2) (&copy; Filmjolk, All Rights Reserved).
